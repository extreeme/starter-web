Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? You can act like a man! Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. It's a Sicilian message.

What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!

Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?
